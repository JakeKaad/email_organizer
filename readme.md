<h1> Epicodus Week 4 assessment </h1>

<p> 
	The pains:
	I am completely frustrated with ember.  It does not provide any clear feedback to you when you are messing something up.  In this case, everytime I create an email, a phantom email is created, and the id is saved to the folder.  I found the item in temporary storage doing some debugging, and it is an exact duplicate of the email that gets saved.  I could not, after 3 hours of debugging, figure out how to get rid of this phantom email from memory.  
</p>


<p>
	The goods:
	I actually felt pretty good about everything else.  I am getting a decent handle on ember and was fortunately able to solve the rest of the tasks relatively easily.  I just don't feel like moving on until I can figure out simple things like model creation.
